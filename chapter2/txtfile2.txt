This is similar to what happens when you are using threads. Just like when
we are sharing the canvas, multiple threads would be executing concurrently
sharing the same memory space. This is more efficient because we’re not
consuming large amounts of memory per execution. In addition, sharing
memory space usually means that you don’t have to merge your work at the
end. Depending on the problem we’re solving, we might reach the solution
more efficiently by sharing the memory with other threads. txtfile3
